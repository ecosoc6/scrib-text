In these circumstances, in view of the unprecedently wide-spread distortion of Marxism, our prime task is to re-establish what Marx really taught on the subject of the state. This will necessitate a number of long quotations from the works of Marx and Engels themselves. Of course, long quotations will render the text cumbersome and not help at all to make it popular reading, but we cannot possibly dispense with them. All, or at any rate all the most essential passages in the works of Marx and Engels on the subject of the state must by all means be quoted as fully as possible so that the reader may form an independent opinion of the totality of the views of the founders of scientific socialism, and of the evolution of those views, and so that their distortion by the “Kautskyism” now prevailing may be



 documentarily proved and clearly demonstrated.



Let us begin with the most popular of Engels’ works,

 The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State

, the sixth edition of which was published in Stuttgart as far back as 1894. We have to translate the quotations from the German originals, as the Russian translations, while very numerous, are for the most part



either incomplete or very unsatisfactory.



Summing up his historical analysis, Engels says: 



“The state is, therefore, by no means a power forced on society from without; just as little is it ‘the reality of the ethical idea’, ‘the image and reality of reason’, as Hegel maintains. Rather, it is a product of society at a certain stage of development; it is the admission that this society has become entangled in an insoluble contradiction with itself, that it has split into irreconcilable antagonisms which it is powerless to dispel. But in order that these antagonisms, these classes with conflicting economic interests, might not consume themselves and society in fruitless struggle, it became necessary to have a power, seemingly standing above society, that would alleviate the conflict and keep it

Preface to the First Edition

Note from Marxist Internet Archive

Lenin wrote 

The State and Revolution

 in August and September 1917, when he was in hiding from persecution of the Provisional Government. The need for such a theoretical work as this was mentioned by Lenin in the second half of 1916. It was then that he wrote his note on &quot;The Youth International&quot;, in which he criticised Bukharin's position on the question of the state and promised to write a detailed article on what he thought to be the Marxist attitude to the state. In a letter to A. M. Kollontai on February 17 (N.S.), 1917, he said that he had almost got ready material on that question . This material was written in a small blue-covered notebook headed &quot;Marxism on the State&quot;. In it Lenin had collected quotations from the works of Marx and Engels, and extracts from the books by Kautsky, Pannekoek and Bernstein with his own critical notes, conclusions and generalisations.

When Lenin left Switzerland for Russia in April 1917, he feared arrest by the Provisional Government and left the manuscript of &quot;Marxism on the State&quot; behind — as it would have been destroyed had he been caught. When in hiding after the July events, Lenin wrote in a note: 

&quot;Entre nous, if I am knocked off, I ask you to publish my notebook 'Marxism on the State' (it got held up in Stockholm). It is bound in a blue cover. All the quotations from Marx and Engels are collected there, also those from Kautsky against Pannekoek. There are a number of remarks, notes and formulas. I think a week's work would be enough to publish it. I consider it important because not only Plekhanov, but Kautsky, too, is confused....&quot; When Lenin received his notebook from Stockholm, he used the material he had collected as a basis for his book The State and Revolution.



According to Lenin's plan, 

The State and Revolution

 was to have consisted of seven chapters, but he did not write the seventh, &quot;The Experience of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917&quot;, and only a detailed plan has remained. In a note to the publisher Lenin wrote that if he &quot;was too slow in competing this, the seventh chapter, or should it turn out to be too bulky, the first six chapters should be published separately as Book One.&quot; 

Originally, the name F.F. Ivanovsky is shown on the first page of the notebook manuscript as that of the author. Lenin intended to publish the book under that pseudonym, otherwise the Provisional Government would have confiscated it for his name alone. The book, however, was not printed until 1918, when there was no longer any need for the pseudonym. The second edition appeared in 1919; in this revision Lenin added to Chapter II a new section &quot;The Presentation of the Question by Marx in 1852&quot;. 

 The question of the state is now acquiring particular importance both in theory and in practical politics. The imperialist war has immensely accelerated and intensified the process of transformation of monopoly capitalism into state-monopoly capitalism. The monstrous oppression of the working people by the state, which is merging more and more with the all-powerful capitalist associations, is becoming increasingly monstrous. The advanced countries - we mean their hinterland - are becoming military convict prisons for the workers.

The unprecedented horrors and miseries of the protracted war are making the people's position unbearable and increasing their anger. The world proletarian revolution is clearly maturing. The question of its relation to the state is acquiring practical importance.

Note on PDF book version

This is a conversion of the Marxist Internet Archive's html files into more traditional book format.  It is hoped that it will be attractive when printed; it may also be viewed onscreen.

Some optical-character-recognition errors in the MIA files have been removed, but italicisation was transferred by hand and it is likely that some italicisation has been lost. The biggest change is that the footnote references have been converted to a more universal form.  References are to chapter, section and, where convenient, paragraph number, rather than to page number as in MIA and previous editions.  Page number references are difficult for the reader to follow unless she has the  particular edition being referenced.  The universal reference form is intended to make the references useful to a wider range of people.

Preface to the First Edition

Preface to the Second Edition

Fabians--members of the Fabian Society, a British reformist organisation founded in 1884. It grouped mostly bourgeois intellectuals--scholars, writers, politicians--including Sydney and Beatrice Webb, Ramsay MacDonald and Bernard Shaw. The Fabians denied the necessity for the proletarian class struggle and for the socialist revolution. They contended that the transition from capitalism to socialism could only be effected through minor social reforms, that is, gradual changes. Lenin described Fabian ideas as &quot;an extremely opportunist trend&quot; (see present edition, Vol. 13, p. 358).





In 1900 the Fabian Society became part of the British Labour Party. &quot;Fabian socialism&quot; is a source of the Labour Party's ideology.





During the First World War the Fabians took a social-chauvinist stand. For Lenin's characterisation of Fabian principles, see Lenin's article &quot;British Pacifism and the British Dislike of Theory&quot; (present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 260-65).

The present, second edition is published virtually unaltered, except that section 3 had been added to Chapter II.
